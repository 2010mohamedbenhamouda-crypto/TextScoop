## 📌 Overview

TextScoop is a web application that analyzes a piece of text to estimate whether it was written by a human or generated by artificial intelligence.

It uses a rule-based approach based on several linguistic features such as lexical diversity, sentence length, and word repetition. The goal is to provide a simple and educational way to understand how automated text analysis works.
